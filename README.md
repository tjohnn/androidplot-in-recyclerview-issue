# androidplot-in-recyclerview-issue
Using android plots in recyclerview, graphs blank off after scrolling past an item and you scroll back into that item if the graph's `renderMode` is set to either `use_background_thread` or `use_main_thread`. This repo is just a reproducable sample for https://github.com/halfhp/androidplot/issues/104
